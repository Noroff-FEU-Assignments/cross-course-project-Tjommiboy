    <h3>Web Security</h3>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[When creating a website there are web security precautions you should take to protect your business and your clients. 
       Malicious attacks can come from both the server side , client side or any other infrastructure and therefore keeping your site up to date is crucial.These are a few steps to achieve this. 
       Sanitizing the data ensuring that its in the right format.
        Creating secure authorization and authentication. This can be done manually (creating a strong password, dont use your date of birth f.ex), or best achieved through an open standard authorization protocol.
        Implementing automatic user timeout is smart so if a user who accidentally left their credentials out to see are secured.  
        These are all measures we can take to prevent security breaches.
